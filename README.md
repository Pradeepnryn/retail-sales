Project Overview

Australian Apparel Ltd. (AAL), founded in 2000, is a prominent clothing brand in Australia with a nationwide presence spanning major states, metropolitan hubs, and tier-1/tier-2 cities. Catering to customers of all age groups—from children to the elderly—AAL has become a household name.

In response to a significant increase in business activity, AAL’s leadership is seeking to expand operations and strengthen performance in underperforming regions. To aid in strategic planning and investment, I need to:
	•Identify states contributing the highest revenue.
	•Design and implement sales improvement programs in low-performing regions.

As part of this,I analyze sales performance across Australian states using data from Q4 2020.

Objectives
	1.	State-wise Sales Analysis:
    	•	Rank states based on revenue.
	    •	Identify high-performing vs low-performing states.
	2.	Strategic Recommendations:
	    •	Recommend targeted sales strategies and promotional programs for states with lower sales.
	    •	Assist decision-makers with data-driven expansion strategies for the coming fiscal year.
Tools & Technologies Used
